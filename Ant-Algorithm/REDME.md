# Ant Colony Algorithm
## These codes contain Ant Colony Optimization algorithm.
## ACO contains conventional Ant Colony algorithm and ACO_R contains Ant Colony algorithm for problems with continuous space.
## ACO solves Traveling Salesman problem as an optimization problem.
## ACO_R algorithms optimize Sphere function as cost function.
## Sphere function: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\bg_white&space;\sum&space;^{n=m}_{n=1}&space;n^{2}" title="\bg_white \sum ^{n=m}_{n=1} n^{2}" />
## int_knapsack solves knapsack problem with ACO
